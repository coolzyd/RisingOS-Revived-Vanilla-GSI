# RisingOS-Revived-Vanilla-GSI
[ZH-CN] RisingOS项目已由新的维护组接收，但新的维护组不再提供GSI镜像，此项目旨在为未被官方适配但支持Project Treble的设备提供RisingOS Revived的GSI镜像文件。注意：此仓库只提供vanilla版本，GAPPS版本由于我的设备super分期不够大而无法完成测试，因而不能提供。

[EN-US] The RisingOS project has been received by the new maintenance group, but the new maintenance group no longer provides GSI images. This project aims to provide the GSI image files of RisingOS Revived for devices that are not officially adapted but support Project Treble. Note: this warehouse only provides the version of vanilla, and the version of GAPPS cannot be provided because my equipment super stage is not big enough to complete the test.
